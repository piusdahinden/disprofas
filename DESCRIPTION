Title: Non-parametric Dissolution Profile Analysis
Description: Similarity of dissolution profiles is assessed using the similarity
    factor f2 according to the EMA guideline (European Medicines Agency 2010)
    \"On the investigation of bioequivalence\". Dissolution profiles are
    regarded as similar if the f2 value is between 50 and 100. For the
    applicability of the similarity factor f2, the variability between profiles
    needs to be within certain limits. Often, this constraint is violated. One
    possibility in this situation is to resample the measured profiles in order
    to obtain a bootstrap estimate of f2
    (Shah et al. (1998) <doi:10.1023/A:1011976615750>). Other alternatives are
    the model-independent non-parametric multivariate confidence region (MCR)
    procedure (Tsong et al. (1996)  <doi:10.1177/F009286159603000427>) or the
    T2-test for equivalence procedure (Hoffelder (2016)
    <http://www.ecv.de/suse_item.php?suseId=Z|pi|8430>). Functions for
    estimation of f1, f2, bootstrap f2, MCR / T2-test for equivalence procedure
    are implemented.
