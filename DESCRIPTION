Description: Similarity of dissolution profiles is assessed using the similarity
    factor f2 according to the EMA guideline (European Medicines Agency 2010)
    'On the investigation of bioequivalence'. Dissolution profiles are regarded
    as similar if the f2 value is between 50 and 100. For the applicability
    of the similarity factor f2, the variability between profiles needs to be
    within certain limits. Often, this constraint is violated. One possibility
    in this situation is to resample the measured profiles to obtain a so-called
    bootstrap estimate of f2. In the literature it is proposed that the lower
    90% bias corrected and accelerated (BCA) confidence interval (CI) limit of
    the bootstrap f2 data should be > 50. Other alternatives for the assessment
    of highly variable dissolution profiles is using the model-independent,
    non-parametric multivariate confidence region (MCR) procedure or the T2-test
    for equivalence procedure. Functions for estimation of f1, f2, bootstrap
    f2 as well as the model-independent MCR procedure and the T2-test for
    equivalence procedure are implemented in this package.
