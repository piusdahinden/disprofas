# disprofas 0.1.3

- Made test parameters of function gep_by_nera more restrictive in order to
  throw a warning on testing.

---

# disprofas 0.1.2

- Example from unexported function was removed.
- Examples that were wrapped by \\dontrun{} although they are executable in
  < 5 sec are now unwrapped.
- Errors from examples that deliberately produce errors are caught by tryCatch()
  and are no longer wrapped by \\dontrun{}.
- The package T2EQ that is used in three examples is listed under 'Suggests'.
  Furthermore, the examples using a function or data sets from this package are
  now wrapped by if(requireNamespace("T2EQ")){} rather than by \\dontrun{}.
